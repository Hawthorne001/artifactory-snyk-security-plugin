# API Configuration
# =================

# Your Snyk API Token for authentication.
# You can find this under your Account's Settings.
# Required.
snyk.api.token=

# Your Snyk Organization ID.
# You can find this under your Organisation's Settings.
# Required.
snyk.api.organization=

# The base URL for all Snyk API endpoints.
# Documentation: https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/api-url
# Default: https://api.snyk.io/
#snyk.api.url=https://api.snyk.io/


# Path to an SSL Certificate for Snyk API in PEM format.
#snyk.api.sslCertificatePath=

# If you are using a proxy, you must provide both Hostname/IP and port.
#snyk.http.proxyHost=
#snyk.http.proxyPort=

# If set to "true", automatically trusts all certificates used by Snyk API.
# Accepts: "true", "false"
# Default: "false"
#snyk.api.trustAllCertificates=false

# By default, if Snyk API hasn't responded within a duration of 60 seconds, the request will be cancelled.
# This property lets you customise the timeout duration in milliseconds.
# Default: "60000"
#snyk.api.timeout=60000

# =====================
# Scanner Configuration
# =====================

# Decides whether the plugin should periodically refresh vulnerability data from Snyk
# or filter access according to results obtained while the package was first requested.
# Without the continuous mode, new vulnerabilities aren't reported for a package that has already been
# allowed through the gatekeeper.
# Accepts: "true", "false"
# Default: "false"
#snyk.scanner.test.continuously=false

# Scan result expiry (continuous mode only). When the most recent scan was made within this time frame,
# filtering respects the previous result. Beyond that time, a new Snyk Test request is made.
# When this property is set to 0, the plugin triggers a test each time an artifact is accessed.
# Default: 168 (1 week)
#snyk.scanner.frequency.hours=168

# How much to extend the scan result expiry when a Snyk Test request fails (continuous mode only).
# In case there is a Snyk request error when the next test is due,
# this parameter allows the plugin to use the previous test result when deciding whether to block access.
# Beyond this extended deadline, the result of filtering will depend on the snyk.scanner.block-on-api-failure param.
# Default: 24 hours (1 day)
#snyk.scanner.extendTestDeadline.hours=24

# By default, if Snyk API fails while scanning an artifact for any reason, the download will be allowed.
# Setting this property to "true" will block downloads when Snyk API fails.
# Accepts: "true", "false"
# Default: "false"
#snyk.scanner.block-on-api-failure=false

# Global threshold for vulnerability issues.
# Accepts: "none", "low", "medium", "high", "critical"
# Default: "low"
#snyk.scanner.vulnerability.threshold=low

# Global threshold for license issues.
# Accepts: "none", "low", "medium", "high"
# Default: "low"
#snyk.scanner.license.threshold=low

# Scan Maven repositories.
# Accepts: "true", "false"
# Default: "true"
#snyk.scanner.packageType.maven=true

# Scan npm repositories.
# Accepts: "true", "false"
# Default: "true"

# Scan PyPi repositories.

# Scan Ruby Gems repositories.
